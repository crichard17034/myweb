				<ul>
					<li><strong>Rocky:</strong> While not an actual pet, this little fella's stopped by the house at the exact same place enough
					times to be considered one.</li>
					<li><strong>Twertle:</strong> A turtle Christian's family adopted after breaking the old rule of <em>"don't take in stray animals from your backyard."</em></li>
					<li><strong>Theo and CeeCee:</strong> Two Guinea Pigs whom Christian don't know too much about. They're more of his sister's thing.</li>

				<h2>Dogs</h2>
				<p>Dogs are very much Christian's prefered species of pet to have and nothing will ever change that.</p>
				
				<img src = "images/Dogs.jpg"
				alt = "Dogs"
				title = "Dogs"
				width= "250" height = "333" />
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Carly:</strong> A Yorkie-Poodle mix who might be a tad overweight, but makes up for it by being the one who sleeps
					with Christian during the night and is the pet he shares the closest bond with.</li>
				
					<li><strong>Shadow:</strong> A Toy Poodle that is a bit of a brat and can't seem to make up her mind if she wants to stay outside
					or inside.</li>
				
					<li><strong>Holly:</strong> A Boston Terrier who likes to lay in sunlight, is a bit gassy, and enjoys licking Christian <strong>way</strong> too much.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Cats</h2>
				<p>Compared to dogs, cats are a bit more... <em>aggressive</em> towards Christian for lack of a better term. Needless to say, he tends to be <em>slightly</em> more cautious around cats.</p>
				
				<img src = "images/Mini.jpg"
				alt = "Mini"
				title = "Mini"
				width= "219" height = "266" />
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Mini:</strong> A Siamese cat that seemingly loves to hide in Christian's closet and sit in boxes for no apparent reason.</li>
			</ul>
				
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Benji:</strong> A tomcat that doesn't like anyone except for Christian's dad and steals the dogs' beds <em>(the little jerk...).</em></li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Meander:</strong> A stray cat we took in after it hung around our porch for a week in the cold <em>(poor guy...)</em>.</li>
			</ul>
