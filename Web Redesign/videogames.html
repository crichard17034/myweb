				<h2>Top 10 Favorite Video Games</h2>
				
				<p>Over the years, Christian has collected and played a sizeable selection of video games in his life. Needless to say, he's come to prefer some of them a lot better than others.</p>

				<br />
				<ol>
					<li><strong>10. Minecraft: </strong>This game defined much of Christian's early childhood, helped him create new friendships, and is the reason he started his first YouTube channel.</li>
					<li><strong>9. Plants Vs. Zombies: </strong> PvZ is a crazy tower defense game with unique and memorable undead foes, 49 unlockable plants, and a charming aesthetic that still holds up to this day.</li>
					<li><strong>8. Sonic and the Black Knight: </strong> This game, while not selling as well as others, still had intresting concepts with swordplay, a unique storybook art style, and a grand story set in the legend of King Arthur.</li>
					<li><strong>7. Sonic Generations: </strong>This game was a 20th anniversary title that celebrated both the past and the present of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.</li>
					<li><strong>6. Super Smash Brothers Ultimate: </strong>This is a massive fighting game which crosses over with many different franchises and features every single character from the past Smash Bros. games with new fighers being constantly added to the roster.</li>
					<li><strong>5. Kirby Super Star Ultra: </strong>This 2008 DS title was a remake of 1996's Kirby Super Star on the SNES and featured updated graphics, new music tracks, 4 new gamemodes, and served as one last celebration of Kirby before the end of the decade.</li>
					<li><strong>4. Freedom Planet: </strong>This retro 2D platformer pays homage to the early SEGA Genesis titles of the 90s through its vibrant graphics and outstanding soundtrack. It also led to me meeting some amazingly talented people in a Discord server, so it 
					gets points for that too.</li>
					<li><strong>3. Kirby's Return to Dreamland: </strong>This title was the first console Kirby game in 11 years and offered up a fun 4-player adventure, defining Kirby for a new generation.</li>
					<li><strong>2. Dragon Ball Fighterz: </strong>This game is a 2.5D fighter with easy to pick-up and hard-to-master gameplay that is filled with love to the Dragon Ball community through animations and character interactions.</li>
					<li><strong>1. Sonic Unleashed: </strong> This was a game filled with fast and frantic action, solid platforming, beat-em-up gameplay, a touching story, an amazing and varied soundtrack, and was one of the last times a Sonic game was ever made with a big budget.</li>
