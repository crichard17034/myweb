				<h2>Top 10 Favorite Video Games</h2>
				
				<p>Over the years, Christian has collected and played a sizeable selection of video games in his life. Needless to say, he's come to prefer some of them a lot better than others.</p>
				
				<br />
				<ol>
					<li><strong>10. Super Smash Brothers Ultimate: </strong> This Switch title is the sixth installment to the massive fighting game which crosses over with many different franchises and features every single character from the past Smash Bros. games with new fighers
					being constantly added to the roster.</li>
					<li><strong>9. Kirby Super Star Ultra: </strong> This 2008 DS title was a remake of 1996's Kirby Super Star on the SNES and featured updated graphics, new music tracks, 4 new gamemodes, and served as one last celebration of Kirby before the end of the decade.</li>
					<li><strong>8. Sonic Adventure 2: </strong> SA2 was a 10th anniversary title that contained high-speed specticle platforming, combo-based mech shooting, explorative treasure hunting, a surprisingly deep pet-raising simulator through the Chao Garden, a memorable 
					soundtrack, and a darker storyline that still manages to keep to the feel of Sonic.</li>
					<li><strong>7. Sonic and the Black Knight: </strong> This game, while not selling as well as others, still had intresting concepts with swordplay, a unique storybook art style, and a grand story set in the legend of King Arthur.</li>
					<li><strong>6. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2: </strong> DBX2 is an action-RPG that improves upon the first game in almost every way with new customization, new characters, a smoother framerate, and tons of fan-service to long-time fans of the franchise with the game still
					being updated after five years.</li>
					<li><strong>5. Sonic Generations: </strong> This game is a 20th anniversary title that celebrated both the past and the present of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise by re-imagining fan-favorite levels in new and inventive ways while still honoring what came before.</li>
					<li><strong>4. Kirby's Return to Dreamland: </strong> This title was the first console Kirby game in 11 years and offered up a fun 4-player adventure, defining Kirby for a new generation.</li>
					<li><strong>3. Freedom Planet: </strong> This retro 2D platformer pays homage to the early SEGA Genesis titles of the 90s through its vibrant graphics and outstanding soundtrack. It also led to me meeting some amazingly talented writers, artists, musicians, and 
					game devs in a Discord server, so it gets points for that too.</li>
					<li><strong>2. Dragon Ball Fighterz: </strong> DBFZ is a 2.5D fighter with easy to pick-up and hard-to-master gameplay that is filled with love to the Dragon Ball community through animations and character interactions.</li>
					<li><strong>1. Sonic Unleashed: </strong> This speed-based platformer was a game filled with fast and frantic action, solid platforming, beat-em-up gameplay, a touching story, an amazing and varied soundtrack, and was one of the last times a Sonic game was ever 
					made with a big budget.</li>
